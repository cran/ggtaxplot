Description: Provides a comprehensive suite of functions for processing and visualizing taxonomic data. It includes functionality to clean and transform taxonomic data, categorize it into hierarchical ranks (such as Phylum, Class, Order, Family, and Genus), and calculate the relative abundance of each category. The package also generates a color palette for visual representation of the taxonomic data, allowing users to easily identify and differentiate between various taxonomic groups. Additionally, it features a river plot visualization to effectively display the distribution of individuals across different taxonomic ranks, facilitating insights into taxonomic visualization.
